# CS370

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
I was given the TreasureMaze.py and GameExperience.py files, which defined the environment and experience replay system. I created the agent logic using deep Q-learning in the notebook (ProjectTwo.ipynb), including the model, training loop, and hyperparameter tuning.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:

 •	What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists solve problems through computational thinking, building software systems that impact everything from healthcare to climate modeling. Our work enables automation, innovation, and global-scale efficiency.

 •	How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I start by breaking down complex problems into manageable pieces, designing logical algorithms, then iteratively implementing and testing solutions—just like training the pirate agent to learn optimal moves.

 •	What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
Ethically, I must ensure my code is reliable, respects user privacy, and avoids harm. I’m responsible for creating transparent, inclusive, and secure solutions aligned with the goals of both users and stakeholders.
